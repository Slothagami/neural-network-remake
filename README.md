# Neural Network Remake
This Project impliments a fully connected neural network libary for python. This model is capable of achieving 97.28% test accuracy on the MNIST image classification dataset, as shown in the [example code](./main.py).

This Project is a revamp of my older [Neural Network from Scratch Project](https://github.com/Slothagami/neural-network) that implimented a convolutional network in the same manner.

## Features
- Highly customizable training process 
- Construct network layers easily with python arrays.
- Support for fully connected and activation layers.
- Several options for activation functions and loss functions including Categorical Cross Entropy loss (CCE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Softmax, Tanh, RElU and Sigmoid functions.
- Helper functions for One Hot encoding.

## Installation
After cloning this repository, you can install all dependences by running the command 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Slothagami/neural-network-remake.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
